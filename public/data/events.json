We try to disambiguate Parfit's insistence that <abbr title=\"Self-interest Theory\">S</abbr> leads to the very irrationality that it aims to resolve, and the moral consequences of there being an <abbr title=\"Self-interest Theory\">S</abbr> in he first place; if indeed such a thing were to exist (as Parfit himself denies).",
